Consistency based Semi-Supervised Learning for Video Dataset<a name="TOP"></a>
===================

To run this project 
---

1. download weights for i3d model from https://github.com/hassony2/kinetics_i3d_pytorch/blob/master/model/model_rgb.pth
2. this 'pth' file should be placed in /weights/ folder
3. Run train_ucf101_csd.py, it should generate and save supervised and unsupervised losses plot
4. Run test_ucf_101.py for evaluation of model
