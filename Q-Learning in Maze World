# Q Learning in Maze World

This project uses Q-learning Implementation to guide robot through a 10x10 Maze. 
I have used Epsilon Greedy Exploration policy, 
where a robot explores it's environment during the starting phase of training and 
focuses more onto exploiting the reward towards the end of training
