Architecture change variations can be seen in AlexNetFeatureWithResnet.py and AlexNetFeaure_skip.py

If you want to run model based on these experiments instead of AlexNetFeature.py, rename the current .py alexnet file that you want to test (from AlexNetFeature_skip and AlexNetFeatureWithResnet) as AlexNetFeature.py
